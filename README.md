Optimised crystal structures of BiSI and BiSeI from density functional theory, calculated using the Vienna *Ab initio* Package (VASP).

Computational Details
-----------------------
The crystal structures of BiSI and BiSeI obtained by Haase-Wessel<sup>1</sup> and Braun et al.<sup>2</sup> were used as the starting point for the calculations.

We have optimised the structures using 4 different functionals: PBEsol, PBEsol + Grimmeâ€™s D3 dispersion correction (PBEsol+D3), PBE, and PBE+D3.
The final structures have been obtained following an iterative procedure where the ion positions, cell shape, and cell volume are allowed to change (`ISIF = 3` in VASP) using a Quasi-Newton algorithm.
